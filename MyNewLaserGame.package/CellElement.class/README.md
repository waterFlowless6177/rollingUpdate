I am at the head of cell hierarchy. I take care of the basic characteristics common to all cell elements. It means the background, the borders, the size.

Each cell element has two ways of addressing: 

1. cell element location in a grid element: it is defined by a point col@row. It is according to the cell model and its location in a grid model.

2. cell element index in an OrderedCollection used for presenting the grid element in a space. It is an integer.
