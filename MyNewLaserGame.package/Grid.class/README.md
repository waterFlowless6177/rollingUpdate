the Grid is responsible for holding the cells that will be shown in a square or rectangle of random size. It will have columns and rows to determine any cell position.

It must have a provision to add specific cells to specific locations, being the location defined by a point object: (numberOfColumn @ numberOfRow). And it should have a mechanism to address cells at specific locations. 

The Grid will activate the laser beam.
